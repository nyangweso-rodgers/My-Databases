# Kafka Connect

# What is Kafka Connect

- **Kafka Connect** is a tool for scalably and reliably streaming data between **Apache Kafka** and other data systems. It makes it simple to quickly define **connectors** that move large data sets in and out of **Kafka**. **Kafka Connect** can ingest entire databases or collect metrics from all your application servers into **Kafka topics**, making the data available for **stream processing** with low latency.

# Types Of Kafka Connectors

- There are two types of Kafka connectors:
  1. **Source connector**: Used to move data from source systems to **Kafka topics**.
  2. **Sink connector**: Used to send data from **Kafka topics** into target (sink) systems.
