# Setting Up Kafka Server on Docker

## Table of Contents

# Setting up Kafka on Docker

- With **Docker**, we don't have to install various tools manually, instead, we write a `docker-compose.yml` to manage **containers**.

# Configure Zookeeper Docker Container

- [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) is a **service** for managing and synchronizing distributed systems. It is a service used to manage **Kafka clusters**.
- **Kafka** uses **Zookeeper** to manage the **brokers** in a **cluster**, and requires **Zookeeper** even if you're running a **Kafka cluster** with only one **broker**.

## Step 1: Configure Zookeeper

- Add configurations for `zookeeper` service

  ```yml
  services:
    zookeeper:
      environment:
        ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
        ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000
        ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_ID: 2
  ```

- Where:
  - `ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT`: instructs `Zookeeper` where it should listen for connections by clients- **Kafka** in our case.
  - `ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_ID`: When running in **clustered mode**, we have to set the `ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_ID`.

# Configure Kafka Docker Container

## Step 1: How to Configure Kafka

- Add configurations for `kafka` service
  ```yml
  services:
    kafka:
      depends_on:
        - zookeeper
      environment:
        KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 1
        KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
        KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka:29092
        KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 2
        KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_MIN_ISR: 2
        KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 2
  ```
- Where:

  - `depends_on` will make sure to start the **zookeeper** container before the **kafka**.

- **Kafka** Environment Variables include:

  1.  `KAFKA_BROKER_ID`: Unique identifier for the **Kafka broker** within the **cluster**. Each broker must have a unique ID.
  2.  `KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT`: Specifies the **Zookeeper** connection string, listing the **Zookeeper** instances that manage **Kafka** metadata and coordinate brokers. i.e., `KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT` instructs **Kafka** where it can find the **Zookeeper**.
  3.  `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS`: Defines how **Kafka brokers** communicate with **clients**. In this case, it uses **plaintext** communication over ports `29092`.
  4.  `KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR`: Sets the replication factor for the internal **offsets** topic, which tracks **consumer offsets**. A higher replication factor increases fault tolerance.
  5.  `KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_REPLICATION_FACTOR`: Sets the **replication factor** for the transaction state log, ensuring that transaction data is replicated for durability.
  6.  `KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_MIN_ISR`: Minimum in-sync replicas required for the transaction state log, ensuring high availability
  7.  `KAFKA_DEFAULT_REPLICATION_FACTOR: '2'`" In **Kafka**, a **topic** can be replicated across multiple **brokers** for redundancy and fault toleranc. The **replication factor** specifies the number of replicas for each **partition** of the **topic**. In this case, with a replication factor of `2`, each **partition** will be copied to two **brokers**.The common default value for this configuration is `2`. This ensures some level of redundancy for user-created topics.
  8.  `KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1`: This configuration specifically targets the **replication factor** for the internal **Kafka offsets topic**. This **topic** is used by **Kafka** to store information about consumer offsets (positions within topics). The default value for this configuration is usually `1`. Since the **offsets topic** stores metadata and is less critical for data integrity compared to user topics, a single replica might be sufficient.
  9.  `KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP`: Defines `key/value` pairs for the security protocol to use, per listener name.

#### Kafka Environment Variables 8: `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS`

- `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS` environment variable specifies the listeners that the **Kafka broker** advertises to other components in the **cluster**. These listeners define the network interfaces and ports on which the broker listens for communication. i.e., `ADVERTISED_LISTENERS` are how **clients** can connect.
- For configuring this correctly, you need to understand that **Kafka brokers** can have multiple **listeners**. A **listener** is a combination of:
  1. Host/IP
  2. Port
  3. Protocol
- Why is it Important?

  - **Client Discovery**: When other components like **producers**, **consumers**, **Schema Registry**, or **Kafka UI** need to connect to the **Kafka broker**, they rely on the **advertised listeners** to discover the broker's address.
  - **Inter-Broker Communication**: **Kafka brokers** use **advertised listeners** to communicate with each other for tasks like leader election and replication.

- `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS` **Syntax**:
  - `Listener Type`: Each entry in the `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS` configuration specifies a **listener type** which define how **clients** can connect to the **Kafka broker**. Common listener types include `PLAINTEXT`, `SSL`, `SASL_SSL`, etc. In our examples, `PLAINTEXT` is used, which means **unencrypted connections**.
  - `Endpoint Configuration`: Each **listener type** is followed by the endpoint configuration, which includes the `hostname` and `port` where clients should connect. The format is `listener_type://hostname:port`. In our examples, `kafka` refers to the `hostname` of the **Kafka broker** container, and `localhost` refers to the `localhost` of the host machine running **Docker**. The `port` specified here should be the `port` on which the **Kafka broker** is running inside the container.
  - `Multiple Listeners`: You can specify multiple listeners by separating them with commas. This allows clients to connect to the **Kafka broker** using different protocols or network configurations. For example, in one configuration, you might expose **Kafka** to the internal Docker network (`kafka:29092`), while in another configuration, you might expose **Kafka** to the host machine's localhost (`localhost:9101`).
  - `Listener Names`: Optionally, you can also specify a **listener name**, which allows you to differentiate between listeners when configuring security settings or client connections.
- **Examples**:

  - `KAFKA_LISTENERS`: is a comma-separated list of listeners and the **host/IP** and port to which Kafka binds to for listening. For more complex networking, this might be an IP address associated with a given network interface on a machine. The default is 0.0.0.0, which means listening on all interfaces.
  - `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka:29092`:This configuration advertises a single listener using the `PLAINTEXT` protocol on port `29092`.
    - The **hostname** used is "`kafka`," which likely refers to the container name for the `Kafka` broker service in a `docker-compose.yml`.
    - This setup exposes the broker only internally within the Docker network.
    - Why? This might be suitable for a simple setup where all components (`Zookeeper`, `Schema Registry`, `Kafka UI`) reside within the same Docker network and use the container name for discovery.
  - `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka:29092,PLAINTEXT_HOST://localhost:9101`: This configuration advertises two listeners:

    - `PLAINTEXT` on port `29092` with hostname "`kafka`" (internal).
    - `PLAINTEXT` on port `9101` with hostname "`localhost`" (external)
    - This setup exposes an internal listener for components within the Docker network and an external listener accessible from the host machine (assuming Docker is running on the host).
    - Why? This allows external **producers** and **consumers** to send messages to the broker using "`localhost:9101`". Internal components can still use "`kafka:29092`".

  - `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://localhost:9101,PLAINTEXT_INTERNAL://kafka:29092`: This configuration prioritizes the external listener. It advertises:

    - `PLAINTEXT` on port `9101` with hostname "`localhost`" (external)
    - `PLAINTEXT` on port `29092` with a custom name "`kafka`" (internal, might not be discoverable by other services).
    - Why? This setup might be useful if you primarily need to access the broker from the host machine (external) and only use internal components for specific tasks. However, the internal listener with a custom name might require additional configuration for other services to connect using "`kafka:29092`".

# Configure Schema Registry Docker Container

## Step 1: How to Configure Schema Registry

- Add configurations for `schema-registry` service

  ```yml
  services:
    schema-registry:
      image: confluentinc/cp-schema-registry:latest
      hostname: schema-registry
      container_name: schema-registry
      depends_on:
        - zookeeper
        - kafka
      ports:
        - "8081:8081"
      environment:
        SCHEMA_REGISTRY_HOST_NAME: schema-registry
        SCHEMA_REGISTRY_KAFKASTORE_CONNECTION_URL: zookeeper:2181
        SCHEMA_REGISTRY_KAFKASTORE_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS: kafka:29092
      restart: unless-stopped
      healthcheck:
        start_period: 10s
        interval: 10s
        retries: 20
        test: curl --user superUser:superUser --fail --silent --insecure http://localhost:8081/subjects --output /dev/null || exit 1
  ```

- **Schema Registry Environment Variables** incldue:
  1.  `depends_on`: Specifies that the **Schema Registry** service depends on **Zookeeper** and **Kafka** services to be up and running. This ensures that **Schema Registry** starts only after its dependencies are available.
  2.  `8081:8081`: Exposes port `8081`, which is the default port for the Schema Registryâ€™s RESTful API.
  3.  `SCHEMA_REGISTRY_HOST_NAME`: Sets the hostname for the Schema Registry service.
  4.  `SCHEMA_REGISTRY_KAFKASTORE_CONNECTION_URL`: Defines the connection URL for **Zookeeper** instances that the **Schema Registry** will use to manage **Kafka** metadata.
  5.  `SCHEMA_REGISTRY_KAFKASTORE_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`: Lists the **Kafka bootstrap servers** for the **Schema Registry** to connect to.

# Configure Kafka REST Proxy Docker Container

- **Kafka REST Proxy** provides a RESTful interface to interact with **Apache Kafka clusters**, allowing applications to produce and consume messages via HTTP. This is particularly useful for clients that do not have a native Kafka library or require an HTTP-based interface for simplicity.

## Kafka REST Proxy Service Configuration

```yml
services:
  rest-proxy:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka-rest:latest
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
      - kafka
      - schema-registry
    ports:
      - "8082:8082"
    hostname: rest-proxy
    container_name: rest-proxy
    environment:
      KAFKA_REST_HOST_NAME: rest-proxy
      KAFKA_REST_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS: "kafka:29092"
      KAFKA_REST_LISTENERS: "http://0.0.0.0:8082"
```

- List of the configurations include:
  1. `depends_on`: Specifies that the Kafka **REST Proxy service** depends on **Zookeeper**, **Kafka**, and **Schema Registry** services to be up and running. This ensures that the **REST Proxy** starts only after its dependencies are available.
  2. `8082:8082`: Exposes port `8082`, which is the default port for the Kafka REST Proxyâ€™s RESTful API.
  3. `KAFKA_REST_HOST_NAME`: Sets the **hostname** for the **Kafka REST Proxy** service.
  4. `KAFKA_REST_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`: Lists the **Kafka bootstrap servers** for the **REST Proxy** to connect to. This enables the proxy to communicate with the Kafka cluster.
  5. `KAFKA_REST_LISTENERS`: Defines the address and port on which the REST Proxy will listen for HTTP requests. In this case, it listens on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 8082.

# 7. ksqlDB Server

- **ksqlDB** is a streaming SQL engine that allows you to create real-time data processing and analytics applications using SQL. It builds on top of **Kafka Streams**, providing an easy-to-use SQL interface for stream processing. With **ksqlDB**, you can define stream transformations, aggregations, joins, windowing, and more using familiar SQL syntax.
- **Key Components** of **ksqlDB** include:
  - **Streams**: Represent unbounded, continuous data flowing from a **Kafka topic**.
  - **Tables**: Represent stateful, aggregated views of streams or other tables.
  - **Queries**: SQL statements that define how to process, transform, and analyze the data.
- Example:

  ```SQL
    -- Create a stream with raw data
    CREATE STREAM raw_data (
        before STRUCT<id INT, value STRING>,
        after STRUCT<id INT, value STRING>,
        source STRUCT<version STRING, connector STRING, name STRING, ts_ms BIGINT, snapshot STRING, db STRING, sequence ARRAY<STRING>, schema STRING, table STRING, txId INT, lsn BIGINT, xmin INT>,
        op STRING,
        ts_ms BIGINT,
        transaction STRUCT<id STRING, total_order BIGINT, data_collection_order BIGINT>
    )
    WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='<topic name>', VALUE_FORMAT='JSON');


    -- Create a new stream with transformed data
    CREATE STREAM transformed_data AS
    SELECT after->id AS id,
          UCASE(after->value) AS value
    FROM raw_data
    WHERE after IS NOT NULL
    EMIT CHANGES;
  ```

  - **DBVisualizer** (Open Source and Commercial): A universal database tool that can connect to various databases and offers advanced SQL querying, though not specifically tailored for stream processing like **ksqlDB**.

# 9. Start The Containers

- start the containers by:
  ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
  ```
- This command will start a new containers named "`kafka`" and map port `29092` of the host machine to port '`29092`' of the container. It also links the "`kafka`" container to the "`zookeeper`" container, so that the `Kafka` container can connect to the `zookeeper` container.
- Check the logs to see the **zookeeper** container has booted up successfully:
  ```sh
    docker logs zookeeper
  ```
- Check the logs to see the kafka server has booted up successfully
  ```sh
    docker logs kafka
  ```
