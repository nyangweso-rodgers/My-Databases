# What is Debezium?

- **Debezium** is an open-source, distributed system that enables users to capture real-time changes so that applications can notice such changes and react to them. It consists of **connectors** that record all real-time data changes and store them as events in **Kafka topics**. **Debezium** uses **connectors** like **MySQL**, **SQL**, **Oracle**, **MongoDB**, and many more for different databases.
