# MongoDB Concepts
1. __MongoDB Server__ is a server-side component which can host multiple databases.
2. __Cluster__: are groups of servers that store your data
3. A __MongoDB database__ is a physical container of collections.
4. A __collection__ in MongoDB is equivalent to a relational database table and it exists within a single database. It includes a group of MongoDB documents.
5. __Document__: includes a set of key value pairs.  All documents include a dynamic schema which means documents which comprise of same collection do not need to have same set of fields and structure.
6. __Replica Sets__: are a set of a few connected mongodb instances that store the same data.
